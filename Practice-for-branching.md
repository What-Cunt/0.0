# Aftermath

Maybe I could  make an Eminem reference but nah, already did. Any case I finished with bracnhing adnd all all I have to do is continue the tutorial. Furthermore this would be used for my replit project. I do want to use Visual Studio Code, it is not as easy yet it is not as intense for computational power as Pycharm seems to be. nonetheless the best course is being well-versed in English and Linux. Oh a little boy can dream. 

# Replit and GOOGLE DRIVE and etc. 

It is a possible thing but the thing is being that replit runs on a server that isn't completely connected to the internet. There is a lot of different function that allow it to be but the main thing is that
# google docs (pydrive) is unable to work on replit, unless i figure out making a local server or use an acutal computer there will always be conflict with the code.
However the best thing I can do is download zip files and extract the folder with the music, perhaps a huge amount of music being zipped and a program that decipher that would be best. 

# Make a local IDE (integrated development enviroment)
visual studio code on the internet?
